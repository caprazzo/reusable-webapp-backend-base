This planet has â€” or rather had â€” a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much all of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans.
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' has already supplanted the great ''Encyclopaedia Galactica'' as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. <br>First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words ''DON'T PANIC'' inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.
"Some factual information for you.  Have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?" <br/> "How much?" said Arthur. <br/> "None at all," said Mr. Prosser.
"The mere thought," growled Mr. Prosser, "hadn't even begun to speculate," he continued, settling himself back, "about the merest possibility of crossing my mind."
[The Guide] says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.
"Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so." <br/> "Very deep," said Arthur, "you should send that in to the ''Reader's Digest.''  They've got a page for people like you."
The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels.
The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.
People of Earth, your attention, please. This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council. As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system. And regrettably, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thank you.
Thereâ€™s no point in acting surprised about it. All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning department in Alpha Centauri for 50 of your Earth years, so youâ€™ve had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and itâ€™s far too late to start making a fuss about it now. â€¦ What do you mean youâ€™ve never been to Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heavenâ€™s sake, mankind, itâ€™s only four light years away, you know. Iâ€™m sorry, but if you canâ€™t be bothered to take an interest in local affairs, thatâ€™s your own lookout. Energize the demolition beams. 
I don't know, apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all.
[as the earth is being destroyed]
One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about humans was their habit of continually stating and repeating the very very obvious, as in <i>It's a nice day,</i> or <i>You're very tall,</i> or <i>Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright?</i>  At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour.  If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up.  After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one.  If they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working.  After a while he abandoned this one as well as being obstructively cynical.
"The Babel fish" said The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quietly, "is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconsious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the consious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.
"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God. The argument goes something like this: <br />`I refuse to prove that I exist,' says God, `for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.' <br />`But,' says Man, `The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.' <br />`Oh dear,' says God, `I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic."
"`Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing."
"Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his bestselling book ''Well That About Wraps It Up For God''."
"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation."
"You know," said Arthur, "it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young."<br/> "Why, what did she tell you?"<br/> "I don't know, I didn't listen."
"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space,  listen..."
Arthur looked up.  "Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for ''Hamlet'' they've worked out."
"Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it."
"But that's not the point!" raged Ford "The point is that I am now a perfectly safe penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly running out of limbs!"
"Five to one against and falling..." she said, "four to one against and falling...three to one...two...one...probability factor of one to one...we have normality, I repeat we have normality." She turned her microphone off â€“ then turned it back on, with a slight smile and continued: "Anything you still canâ€™t cope with is therefore your own problem." 
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," Marvin said.
He reached out and pressed an invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up with the words ''Please do not press this button again''.
''"All the doors in this spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done."''
"Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you down to the bridge. Call that ''job satisfaction?'' 'Cos I don't." 
"Sorry, did I say something wrong?" said Marvin, dragging himself on regardless. "Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed. Here's another one of those self-satisfied doors. ''Life!'' Don't talk to me about life."
"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now." -Zaphod Beeblebrox
One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard, pretending to be stupid because he couldn't be bothered to think and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.
Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning.<br/>"...and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left hand side..."<br/>"No?" said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him.  "Really?"<br/>"Oh yes," said Marvin, "I mean I've asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens."<br/>"I can imagine."
â€œFunny,â€� he intoned funerally, â€œhow just when you think life canâ€™t possibly get any worse it suddenly does.â€�
He had found a Nutri-Matic machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.
Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was ''Oh no, not again.''  Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.
"Life," said Marvin dolefully, "loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it."
For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the same reasons. 
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the 'Star Spangled Banner', but in fact the message was this: ''So long and thanks for all the fish.'' 
Looking up into the night sky is looking into infinity - distance is incomprehensible and therefore meaningless. 
"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.
"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that quite definitely is the answer.  I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is."<br>"But it was the Great Question!  The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything," howled Loonquawl.<br>"Yes," said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools gladly, "but what actually ''is'' it?"<br>A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the computer and then at each other.<br>"Well, you know, it's just Everything ... Everything ..." offered Phouchg weakly.<br>"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you know what the question actually is, you'll know what the answer means."
"The chances of finding out what's really going on in the universe are so remote, the only thing to do is hang the sense of it and keep yourself occupied... Look at me: I design coastlines... I'd far rather be happy than right any day."<br/>"And are you?"<br/> "No, that's where it all falls down, of course."</br>"Pity, it sounded like quite a good lifestyle otherwise."
The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R17 through the steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning twilight. Ghastly grey lights congealed on the land. <br/>R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being more than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances, since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable stress, ulcers and even death. <br/>R17 is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast.
"What's up?"<br/> "I don't know," said Marvin, "I've never been there."
"Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it," said Marvin.<br/>"And what happened?" pressed Ford.<br/>"It committed suicide," said Marvin and stalked off back to the Heart of Gold.
It said: "The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.<br/>"For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question ''How can we eat?'' the second by the question ''Why do we eat?'' and the third by the question ''Where shall we have lunch?"''
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.<br/>There is another theory which states that this has already happened.
The story so far:<br/>In the beginning the Universe was created.<br/>This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.
"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the hugely successful Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent profit in recent years.
The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.
Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on.  <br/> Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as something to be avoided than harped upon.  <br/> Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought that they might just feel the same way about him and, what's more, be able to do something about helping to postpone this reunion.
"Concentrate," hissed Zaphod, "on his name." <br/> "What is it?" asked Arthur.  <br/> "Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth." <br/> "What?" <br/> "Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.  Concentrate!" <br/> "The Fourth?" <br/>  "Yeah.  Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third..." <br/> "What?"  <br/>  "There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine.  Now concentrate!"
...By an equally suspicious freak of temporal relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before the beach bars close.<br/>No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the dominant life forms on Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their time attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running round swimming pools, and inviting Investigation Officials from the Galactic Geo-Temporal Control Board to "have a nice diurnal anomaly."
The ''Guide'' is definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate. 
"Well sir," snapped the fragile little creature, "if you could be a little cool about it..."<br/>"Look," said Zaphod. "I'm up to here with cool, okay? I'm so amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat in me for a month. I'm so hip I have trouble seeing over my pelvis. Now will you move before I blow it?"
"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me, I get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal."
"You ''are'' Zaphod Beeblebrox?" [the insect] squeeked.<br/>"Yeah," said Zaphod, "but don't shout it out or they'll all want one."<br/>"''The'' Zaphod Beeblebrox?"<br/>""No, just ''a'' Zaphod Beeblebrox; didn't you hear I come in six packs?"
"Mr. Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so weird you should be in movies."<br/>"Yeah," said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing, "and you, baby, should be in real life."
"I'm looking for someone."<br/>"Who?" hissed the insect.<br/>"Zaphod Beeblebrox," said Marvin, "he's over there."<br/>The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak.<br/>"Then why did you ask ''me''?"<br/>"I just wanted something to talk to," said Marvin.<br/>"What!"<br/>"Pathetic, isn't it?"
"So, how are you?" [Zaphod] said aloud.<br/>"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me, which personally I don't."
"Marvin," he said, "just get this elevator to go up, will you?  We've got to get to Zarniwoop."<br/>"Why?" asked Marvin dolefully.<br/>"I don't know," said Zaphod, "but when I find him, he'd better have a very good reason for me wanting to see him."
I am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my body?
Shee, you guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off.
"Maybe somebody here tipped off the Galactic Police," said Trillian.  "Everyone saw you come in."<br/>"You mean they want to arrest me over the phone?" said Zaphod.  "Could be.  I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm cornered."<br/>"Yeah," said the voice from under the table, "you go to pieces so fast people get hit by the shrapnel."
"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third ten million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit of a decline."
"Er..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment."<br/>He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his throat.<br/>"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a minâ€”"<br/>And so the Universe ended.
"Amazing-looking ship though.  Looks like a fish, moves like a fish, steers like a cow."
It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.
The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engines howled and whined like tired children in a supermarket.
The trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is basically one of them not being worth all the bother.  On Earth â€“ when there had been an Earth, before it was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass â€“ the problem had been with cars. The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another â€“ particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke and short of fish.
The designer of the gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make it evil," he'd been told. "Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sort of spikes and prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is a gun for going out and making people miserable with."
The major problem â€” ''one'' of the major problems, for there are several â€” one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them.<br/>To summarize: it is a well known fact that those people who most ''want'' to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.
"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past isn't a fiction designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate physical sensations and my state of mind?" 
 "Well, youâ€™re obviously being totally naive of course", said the girl, "When youâ€™ve been in marketing as long as I have, you'll know that before any new product can be developed it has to be properly researched. Weâ€™ve got to find out what people want from fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them."<br/>The crowd were tense.  They were expecting something wonderful from Ford.<br/>"Stick it up your nose," he said.<br/>"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know," insisted the girl, "Do people want fire that can be fitted nasally?"
"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy? It sounds a terribly interesting project."<br/>"Ah," said the marketing girl, "Well, we're having a little difficulty there."<br/>"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford.  "Difficulty?  What do you mean, difficulty?  It's the single simplest machine in the entire Universe!"<br/>The marketing girl soured him with a look.<br/>"Alright, Mr. Wiseguy," she said, "if you're so clever, you tell us what colour it should be."
The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was.
The alien ship was already thundering toward the upper reaches of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void that separates the very few things there are in the Universe from one another.
In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and that terrible listlessness that starts to set in about 2:55, when you know youâ€™ve taken all the baths that you can usefully take that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the newspaper you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four oâ€™clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.
"Africa was very interesting," said Ford, "I behaved very oddly there." [...] "I took up being cruel to animals," he said airily.  "But only," he added, "as a hobby."<br/>"Oh yes," said Arthur, warily.<br/>"Yes," Ford assured him.  "I won't disturb you with the details because they wouldâ€”"<br/>"What?"<br/>"Disturb you.  But you may be interested to know that I am singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe."
He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off.
"I have detected," he said, "disturbances in the wash." [...]<br/>"The wash?" said Arthur.<br/>"The space-time wash," said Ford. [...]<br/>Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat.  "Are we talking about," he asked cautiously, "some sort of Vogon laundromat, or what are we talking about?"<br/>"Eddies," said Ford, "in the space-time continuum."<br/>"Ah," nodded Arthur, "is he?  Is he?"  He pushed his hands into the pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the distance.<br/>"What?" said Ford.<br/>"Er, who," said Arthur, "is Eddy, then, exactly, then?"
"There!" said Ford, shooting out his arm.  "There, behind that sofa!"<br/>Arthur looked.  Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley-covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them.  He boggled intelligently at it.  Shrewd questions sprang into his mind.<br/>"Why," he said, "is there a sofa in that field?"<br/>"I told you!" shouted Ford, leaping to his feet.  "Eddies in the space-time continuum!"<br/>"And this is his sofa, is it?" asked Arthur, struggling to his feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his senses.
The first nonabsolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up [...].
The second nonabsolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of mathematical concepts, a recipriversexlusion, a number whose existence can only be defined as being anything other than itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the party will arrive.
"My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre," Ford muttered to himself, "and that I am therefore excused from saving Universes."
Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small, cold and slightly damp.
There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath.<br/>The moment passed as it regularly did on Squornshellous Zeta, without incident.
Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in an infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in which we live, most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot of things one would rather not, grow somewhere.
"My capacity for happiness," he added, "you could fit into a matchbox without taking out the matches first." ''â€”Marvin''
"You may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, but that is because  my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number."<br/>"Er, five," said the mattress.<br/>"Wrong," said Marvin. "You see?"<br/>The mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was in the presence of a not unremarkable mind.
"I would like to say that it is a very great pleasure, honour and privilege for me to open this bridge, but I can't because my lying circuits are all out of commission."''â€”Marvin''
"Voon," [the mattress] wurfed at last, "and was it a magnificent occasion?"<br/>"Reasonably magnificent. The entire thousand-mile-long bridge spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping into the mire, taking everybody with it."
[...] the renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink.  He drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it.  He then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right.<br/>"Freedom," he said aloud.<br/>Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom.<br/>"I can't cope with it," Zaphod said darkly, and sent a third drink down to see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition of the first.  He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right.<br/>He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together they would get the second to pull itself together. Then all three would go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well.<br/>He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully and a sixth for moral support.
[''The Guide''] had some advice to offer on drunkenness.<br/>"Go to it," it said, "and good luck."<br/>It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size of the Universe and the ways of coping with that.
There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. [...] Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.
Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful.
[Zaphod] sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on. He decided that there must be someone in the Universe feeling more wretched, miserable and forsaken than himself, and he determined to set out and find him.<br/>Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, and he returned to bed.
On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture, sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms.
They obstinately persisted in their absence.
It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes.
Marvin droned,<br>''Now the world has gone to bed,<br>Darkness don't engulf my head,<br>I can see by infrared,<br>How I hate the night.''<br>He paused to gather artistic and emotional strength to tackle the next verse.<br>''Now I lay me down to sleep,<br>Try to count electric sheep,<br>Sweet dream wishes you can keep,<br>How I hate the night.''
"That young girl," Marvin added unexpectedly, "is one of the least benightedly unintelligent organic life forms it has been my profound lack of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting."
"Excuse me," [Arthur] said, "the Ashes. I've got them. They were stolen by those white robots a moment ago [...] what should I do with them?"<br>The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he was speaking metaphorically.
He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn't an afterlife.
If a sunbeam had ever managed to slink this far into the justice complex of Argabuthon it would have turned around and slunk straight back out again
â€œI'm afraid,â€� he said at last, â€œthat the Question and the Answer are mutually exclusive. Knowledge of one logically precludes knowledge of the other. It is impossible that both can ever be known about the same Universe.â€�
"I wasn't very impressed with it when I first knew what it was," he said, "but now I think back to how impressed I was by the Prince's reason, and how soon afterward I couldn't recall it at all, I think it might be a lot more helpful. Would you like to know what it is? Would you?" They nodded dumbly. "I bet you would. If you're that interested I suggest you go and look for it. It is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun Zarss in Galactic Sector QQ7 ActiveJ Gamma. it is guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob."<br>There was a long silence following this announcement, which was finally broken by Arthur. "Sorry, it's where?" he said.<br>"It is written," repeated Prak, "in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the..."<br>"Sorry," said Arthur again, "which mountains?"<br>"The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on the planet..."<br>"Which land was that? I didn't quite catch it."<br>"Sevorsbeupstry, on the planet..."<br>"Sevorbe what?"<br>"Oh, for heaven's sake," said Prak, and died testily.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have left the oceans. <br/> And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small cafÃ© in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.<br/>Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass, and so the idea was lost, seemingly for ever.<br/>This is her story.
Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbor's boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them, the huskies have pissed on.
And as he drove on, the rain clouds dragged down the sky after him for, though he did not know it, Rob McKenna was a Rain God. All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him and to water him.
They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images the eyes resolved was not the same brain. There had been no surgery involved, just the continual wrenching of experience.
Once you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is a very useful device for enabling you to know that it is.
He paused and maneuvered his thoughts. It was like watching oil tankers doing three-point turns in the English Channel.
He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily, dirty, rainbow-hung Earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the Universe.
The problem is, or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a sizeable proportion of which are continually clogging up the civil, commercial, and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones, this.<br/>The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem.<br/>This is:<br/>Change.<br/>Read it through again and you'll get it.
''Ford:'' "Life," he said, "is like a grapefruit."<br/>''Creature:'' "Er, how so?" <br/>''Ford:'' "Well, it's sort of orangey-yellow and dimpled on the outside, wet and squidgy in the middle. It's got pips inside, too. Oh, and some people have half a one for breakfast."
"This Arthur Dent," comes the cry from the furthest reaches of the galaxy, and has even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe thought to originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too hideous to contemplate, "what is he, man or mouse? Is he interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life? Has he no spirit? has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a nutshell, fuck?"<br>Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip on to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it.
And as they drifted up, their minds sang with the ecstatic knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of catching up to do.
In a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming among the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering around the wings of an airplane but can never feel because you are sitting warm inside the stuffy airplane and looking through the little scratchy Plexiglas window while somebody else's son tries patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt.
She was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong.
The sign said:<br/>''Hold stick near centre of its length. Moisten pointed end in mouth. Insert in tooth space, blunt end next to gum. Use gentle in-out motion.''<br/>"It seemed to me," said Wonko the Sane, "that any civilization that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks, was no longer a civilization in which I could live and stay sane."
"I'm afraid I can't comment on the name Rain God at this present time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para-Causal Meteorological Phenomenon."<br>"Can you tell us what that means?"<br>"I'm not altogether sure. Let's be straight here. If we find something we can't understand we like to call it something you can't understand, or indeed pronounce. I mean if we just let you go around calling him a Rain God, then that suggests that you know something we don't and I'm afraid we couldn't have that."
The ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' [...] says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation products that "it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to work at all."
"I come in peace," [the silver robot] said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, "take me to your Lizard."
"So much time," it groaned, "oh so much time.  And pain as well, so much of that, and so much time to suffer it in too.  One or the other on its own I could probably manage.  It's the two together that really get me down."
"Ha!" snapped Marvin.  "Ha!" he repeated.  "What do you know of always? You say 'always' to me, who, because of the silly little errands your organic lifeforms keep on sending me through time on, am now thirty-seven times older than the Universe itself? Pick your words with a little more care," he coughed, "and tact."
"We apologise for the inconvenience." ''God's Final Message to His Creation, written in letters of fire on the side of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains.''<br/>"I think," Marvin murmured at last, from deep within his corroding rattling thorax, "I feel good about it."<br/>The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time ever.
There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler's mind.
Anything that happens, happens.<br/>Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen.<br/>Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again.<br/>It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though.
One of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the difficulties involved in trying to exceed it. You can't. Nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws.
The last time anybody made a list of the top hundred character attributes of New Yorkers, common sense snuck in at number 79.
"But you like the way it's changed?" demanded Ford.<br>"I like ''everything''," moaned the robot. "Especially when you shout at me like that. Do it again, ''please''."<br>"Just tell me what's happened!"<br>"Oh, thank you, thank you!"
The current editor-in-chief, Stagyar-zil-Doggo, was a dangerously unbalanced man who took a homicidal view of contributing staff turning up in his office without pages of fresh, proofed copy, and had a battery of laser-guided guns linked to special scanning devices in the door frame to deter anybody who was merely bringing extremeley good reasons why they hadn't written any. Thus was a high level of output maintained.
[The Ident-I-Eeze] encoded every single piece of information about you, your body and your life into one all-purpose machine-readable card that you could then carry around in your wallet, and it therefore represented technology's greatest triumph to date over both itself and plain common sense.
"You stay there," said Ford, "and you'll soon be recaptured and have your conditional chip replaced. You want to stay happy, come now."<br>The robot let out a long heartfelt sigh of impassioned tristesse and sank reluctantly away from the ceiling.
When the ''Guide'' moved on, taking its building with it, it left a little like a thief in the night. Exactly like a thief in the night in fact. It usually left in the very early hours of the morning, and the following day there always turned out to be a very great deal of stuff missing. Whole cultures and economies would collapse in its wake, often within a week, leaving once-thriving planets desolate and shell-shocked but still somehow feeling they had been part of some great adventure.
It was a programming technique that had been reverse-engineered from the sort of psychotic mental blocks that otherwise perfectly normal people had been observed invariably to develop when elected to high political office.
The doors of the elevator slid open to reveal a large posse of security guards and robots poised waiting for it and brandishing filthy-looking weapons.<br>They ordered him out.<br>With a shrug he stepped forward. The all pushed rudely past him into the elevator, which took them down to continue their search for him on the lower levels.<br>This was fun, thought Ford [...].
"Protect me from knowing what I don't need to know. Protect me from even knowing that there are things to know that I don't know. Protect me from knowing that I decided not to know about the things that I decided not to know about. Amen."
"There's another prayer that goes with it that's very important. [...] 'Lord, lord, lord. Protect me from the consequences of the above prayer. Amen' And that's it. Most of the trouble people get into in life comes from leaving out that last part."
If any of them had chosen to look out of the window at that moment, they would have been startled by the sight of Ford Prefect dropping past them to his certain death and flipping the finger at them.
Sub-editors. Bastards. What about all that copy of his they'd cut? Fifteen years of research he'd filed from one planet alone and they'd cut it to two words. "Mostly harmless." The finger to them as well.
The thing they wouldn't be expecting him to do was to be there in the first place.  Only an absolute idiot would be sitting where he was, so he was winning already.  A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.
The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair.
It wasn't merely that their left hand didn't always know what their right hand was doing, so to speak; quite often their right hand had a pretty hazy notion as well.
"Colin," he said, turning to the little, hovering ball. "I am going to abandon you to your fate."<br>"I'm so happy," said Colin.<br>"Make the most of it," said Ford. "Because what I want you to do is nursemaid that package out of the building. They'll probably incinerate you when they find you, and I won't be here to help. It will be very, very nasty for you, and that's just too bad. Got it?"<br>"I gurgle with pleasure," said Colin.
So everything was going well, was it? Everything was working out as if the most extraordinary luck was on his side? Well, he'd see about that.<br>In a spirit of scientific inquiry he hurled himself out of the window again.
"So what's the point of showing me something I can't see?"<br>"So that you understand that just because you see something, it doesn't mean to say it's there. And if you don't see something, it doesn't mean to say it's not there. It's only what your senses bring to your attention."
"Your universe is vast to you. Vast in time, vast in space. That's because of the filters through which you perceive it. But I was built with no filters at all, which means I perceive the Mish Mash which contains all possible universes but which has, itself, no size at all. For me, anything is possible. I am omniscient and omnipotent, extremely vain and, what is more, I come in a handy self-carrying package. You have to work out how much of the above is true."
"Reverse engineering enables us to shortcut all the business of waiting for one of those horribly few spaceships that passes through your galactic sector every year or so to make up its mind about whether or not it feels like giving you a lift. You want a lift, a ship arrives and gives you one. The pilot may think he has any one of a million reasons why he has decided to stop and pick you up. The real reason is that I have determined that he will."<br>"This is you being extremely vain, isn't it, little bird?"
It would be hard to say which he was more frightened of: that he might have hurt the person he had inadvertently sat on or that the person he had inadvertently sat on would hurt him back.
"Why are we surrounded by squirrels, and what do they want?"<br>"I've been pestered by squirrels all night," said Arthur. "They keep on trying to give me magazines and stuff."
"I think it may be something unimaginably dangerous."<br>"And you sent it to ''me''?" protested Arthur.<br>"Safest place I could think of. I thought I could rely on you to be absolutely boring and not open it."
"What did she say?"<br>"She hit me on the head with the rock again."<br>"I think I can confirm that that was my daughter."<br>"Sweet kid."<br>"You have to get to know her," said Arthur.<br>"She eases up, does she?"<br>"No," said Arthur, "but you get a better sense of when to duck."
"This is very, very serious indeed. The ''Guide'' has been take over. It's been bought out."<br>Arthur leapt up. "Oh, very serious," he shouted. "Please fill me in straight away on some corporate publishing politics! I can't tell you how much it's been on my mind of late!"<br>"You don't understand!  There's a whole new ''Guide''!"<br/>"Oh!" shouted Arthur again.  "Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  I'm incoherent with excitement!  I can hardly wait for it to come out to find out which are the most exciting spaceports to get bored hanging about in in some globular cluster I've never heard of.  Please, can we rush to a store that's got it right this very instant?"<br/>Ford narrowed his eyes.  "This is what you call sarcasm, isn't it?"<br/>"Do you know," bellowed Arthur, "I think it is?  I really think it might just be a crazy little thing called sarcasm seeping in at the edges of my manner of speech!  Ford, I have had a ''fucking'' bad night!  Will you please try and take that into account while you consider what fascinating bits of ''badger-sputumly'' inconsequential trivia to assail me with next?"
"Temporal reverse engineering."<br/>Arthur put his head in his hands and shook it gently from side to side.<br/>"Is there any humane way," he moaned, "in which I can prevent you from telling me what temporary reverse bloody-whatsiting is?"
"I leaped out of a high-rise office window."<br/>This cheered Arthur up. "Oh!" he said.  "Why don't you do it again?"<br/>"I did."<br/>"Hmmm," said Arthur, disappointed.  "Obviously no good came of it."
"What was the self-sacrifice?"<br>"I jettisoned half of a much-loved and I think irreplaceable pair of shoes."<br>"Why was that self-sacrifice?"<br>"Because they were mine!" said Ford, crossly.<br>"I think we have different value systems."<br>"Well, mine's better."
It wasn't [the Captain's] job to worry about that, though. It was his job to do his job, which was to do his job. If that led to a certain narrowness of vision and circularity of thought, then it wasn't his job to worry about such things. Any such things that came his way were referred to others, who had, in turn, other people to refer such things to.
Somewhere on a fetid, fog-bound mud bank on [Vogsphere] there stands, surrounded by the dirty, broken and empty carapaces of the last few jeweled scuttling crabs, a small stone monument which marks the place where, it is thought, the species ''Vogon Vogonblurtus'' first arose. On the monument there is carved an arrow which points away, into the fog, under which is inscribed in plain, simple letters the words "The buck stops there."
Where do I fit?
A tremendous feeling of peace came over him. He knew that at last, for once and for ever, it was now all, finally, over.
Do you want me to sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where I'm standing?
Life, don't talk to me about life
I seem to be having this tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle. As soon as I reach some kind of definite policy about what is my kind of music and my kind of restaurant and my kind of overdraft, people start blowing up my kind of planet and throwing me out of their kind of spaceships! 
Zaphod: Can it Trillian, I'm trying to die with dignity.<br/>Marvin: I'm just trying to die.
The other Shaltanac's joopleberry shrub is always a more mauvy shade of pinky-russet.
Zaphod: The building's being bombed! Who in their right minds would want to bomb a publishing company?
What to do if you find yourself stuck in a crack in the ground underneath a giant boulder you can't move with no hope of rescue: <br/>Consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far. <br/>Alternatively, if life hasn't been good to you so far (which, given your current circumstances, seems more likely): <br/>Consider how lucky you are that it won't be troubling you much longer. 
Life, as many people have spotted, is, of course, terribly unfair. For instance, the first time the Heart of Gold ever crossed the galaxy the massive improbability field it generated caused two-hundred-and-thirty-nine thousand lightly-fried eggs to materialise in a large, wobbly heap on the famine-struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system. The whole Poghril tribe had just died out from famine, except for one man who died of cholesterol-poisoning some weeks later. 
The Book: It is said that his birth was marked by earthquakes, tidal waves, tornadoes, firestorms, the explosion of three neighbouring stars, and, shortly afterwards, by the issuing of over six and three quarter million writs for damages from all of the major landowners in his Galactic sector. However, the only person by whom this is said is Beeblebrox himself, and there are several possible theories to explain this.
Will everything tie up neatly or will it be just like life: quite interesting in parts, but no substitute for the real thing? 
I ache, therefore I am.
Man in Shack: The lord knows I am not cruel man.
Zarniwoop: Ah-- you say, `the lord', so, you believe in--
Man in Shack: My cat.  I call him 'the lord'.  I am kind to him.
Zarniwoop: Alright.  How do you know he exists?  How do you know he knows you to be kind or enjoys what you think of as your kindness?
Man in Shack: I don't.  I have no idea.  It merely pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a cat.  What else do you do? ...Please, I am tired.
Was I amongst friends when the Haggunenon admiral evolved into a life pod and everybody aboard his flagship escaped leaving me aboard as it steered itself into the nearest star? <br/>Was I amongst friends when I was left to walk in circles on a swamp planet? <br/>Left to park cars outside a restaurant for millenia? <br/>Left for the Krikkit robots to use for batting practice? <br/>Friend? I don't think I ever came across one of those, sorry, can't help you there.
Marvin: This is the car park, you ordered a babe wash for your ship. Due to staff shortages, I am your babe.
Zaphod: Marvin-- I thought you were dead!
Marvin: Seems I was still under warranty, sorry to disappoint you, sorrier than you can possibly imagine.
Zaphod: You're still parking cars here?
Marvin: Spend a few thousand million years in a job and eventually you get promoted, I have my own bucket now. Finally, I am somebody
Zaphod: OK metal man, how about giving the heart of gold a hot wax with full valet?
Marvin: That depends on whether or not I can find my frilly apron, with my luck, I probably can.
Humans are not proud of their ancestors, and rarely invite them round to dinner.
What do you think I am, completely without any moral whatsits, what are they called, those moral things?
